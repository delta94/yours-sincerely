# Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`../server/dschemaschema.graphql`](../server/schema/schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the [GraphQL Playground](http://localhost:5000/playground).

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Retrieve all published posts and their authors

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Register a new user

You can send the following mutation in the Playground to sign up a new user and retrieve an authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    email: "im.kaiyu@gmail.com",
    password: "graphql"
  }) {
    email
  }
}
```

#### Log in an existing user

This mutation will log in an existing user by requesting a new authentication token for them:

```graphql
mutation {
  login(username: "im.kaiyu@gmail.com", password: "graphql") {
    token
  }
}
```

#### Check whether a user is currently logged in with the `me` query

For this query, you need to make sure a valid authentication token is sent along with the `Bearer`-prefix in the `Authorization` header of the request:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __YOUR_TOKEN__"
}
```

With a real token, this looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJjanAydHJyczFmczE1MGEwM3kxaWl6c285IiwiaWF0IjoxNTQzNTA5NjY1fQ.Vx6ad6DuXA0FSQVyaIngOHYVzjKwbwq45flQslnqX04"
}
```

Inside the Playground, you can set HTTP headers in the bottom-left corner:

Once you've set the header, you can send the following query to check whether the token is valid:

```graphql
{
  me {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

#### Create a new draft

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground.

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    content: "Join our Slack: https://slack.itsbananas.com"
    authorEmail: "im.kaiyu@gmail.com"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

#### Publish an existing draft

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  publish(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Search for posts with a specific title or content

```graphql
{
  filterPosts(searchString: "graphql") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

#### Retrieve a single post

```graphql
{
  posts(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    content
    published
    author {
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.

#### Delete a post

You need to be logged in for this query to work, i.e. an authentication token that was retrieved through a `signup` or `login` mutation needs to be added to the `Authorization` header in the GraphQL Playground. The authentication token must belong to the user who created the post.

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(id: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You need to replace the `__POST_ID__`-placeholder with an actual `id` from a `Post` item. You can find one e.g. using the `filterPosts`-query.
